# The Effect of Convenience and Personality on Bike Sharing Preferences

This project was part of a research project that aimed to construct a comprehensive model that would have a better ability to predict one's bike sharing preferences compared to the models developed in previous research studies. This study collected data (n = 112) on personality traits (neuroticism, openness), convenience factors (neighborhood, distance from nearest bike depot, income, and bike ownership), and included a set of demographic (gender, age, job etc.) and non-demographic (working hours, transport, car ownership etc.) control variables. Using multivariate regression analysis in RStudio it was found that the model could predict 20% of variance in bike sharing preference, and that within the model, openness positively and income negatively predicted bike sharing preference. This model could be used by both bike sharing companies and governments to encourage individuals who are likely to use bike sharing services to do so.

This study was commissioned by Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University, and was conducted between October and November 2018, together with my colleagues, Freddie Simons, Sjoerd Paulissen, Laura Viero, and Jiaxin Ma.
